# Botkit simple bot

First chat bot created (woohoo)! Created with Cisco Webex Teams and Botkit, and hosted on Glitch.

Based on the Botkit Starter Kit for Cisco Spark Bots.

Only the bot.js and environment variables were changed. The files inside nested directories were not used.

What this bot can do:

- Notice when you send it a direct message (and repeat it back to you)
- Notice when you mention it in a group chat with @botname (and repeat it back to you)
- Reply "Hi" when "Hello" is said in a direct message or mention.
